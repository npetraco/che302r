Angular momentum matrix elements and matrices

Simulation, perhaps:
2D particle simulation in a box
  different size boxes (square, retangle, sphere, etc??)
  change potentials
1D and 2D Isin models

UV-vis simulation functions.

IN PROGRESS Break out functions/data that depend on colorscience library into a stand alone
            library eg, colorscience_util and get rid of explicit dependency on colorscience

DONE Get rid of exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+") in NAMESPACE and export all functions

DONE Put constants in use_data or export them all??
