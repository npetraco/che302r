Angular momentum matrix elements and matrices

Simulation, perhaps:
2D particle simulation in a box
  different size boxes (square, retangle, sphere, etc??)
  change potentials

UV-vis simulation functions.

Break out functions/data that depend on colorscience library into a stand alone
library eg, colorscience_util and get ride of explicit dependency on colorscience
